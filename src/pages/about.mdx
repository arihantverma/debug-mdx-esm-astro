ART is true love for Natasha expresses herself best through this medium. Born and raised in Mumbai into a family that espoused love and respect for humanity, progressive beliefs and a liberal philosophy, and having spent close to seventeen years in teaching and research in cosmopolitan and multicultural cities (earning a doctoral degree in Singapore), it isn’t surprising to note that Natasha’s artistic practice is ‘socially engaged’. As a visual artist, her pictorial language and thematic preferences are revealing of how responsive she is to either the prevalent or enduring mood in society as reflected through cultural, social, political, and environmental phenomena.

Vibrant compositions, bright colours, and the use of identifiable symbolic imagery characterize Natasha’s artwork. Experimentation with geometric forms rather than organic, asymmetrical shapes make for a strong visual impact. Irony and satire constitute key components for making the occasional impactful statement about current events or challenging the status quo.

Joy, to Natasha, lies in inspiring others into imagining things in new and unexpected ways through her compositions.
